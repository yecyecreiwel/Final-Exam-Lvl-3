1. Differentiate between Multiprocessing and Multithreading. Explain.
In order to perform functions and code in parallel, multitasking is useful. For example, if two operations are independent of one another, 
they may be separated into separate for-loops. The capacity of a processor to operate many threads simultaneously, each of which runs a process, 
is known as multithreading. While multiprocessing refers to a system's capacity to use many processors simultaneously,
each of which is capable of managing one or more threads.

2. Explain the difference between Serial Computing and Parallel
Computing.
Serial processing does a single operation at a time, whereas parallel processing executes numerous tasks at once. 
This is the primary distinction between serial and parallel processing in computer architecture.
A computer system's functionality, structure, and implementation are determined by its computer architecture. 
It outlines the architecture of the computer system and the technologies it can work with. One of the most crucial parts of the computer system is the CPU. 
It carries out commands and finishes the duties given to it. Serial and parallel processing are the two primary forms of processing.
