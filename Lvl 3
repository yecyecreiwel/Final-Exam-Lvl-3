1. Differentiate between Multiprocessing and Multithreading. Explain.

2. Explain the difference between Serial Computing and Parallel
Computing.

3. Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first will
be a list of numbers. The second parameter will be a string that can
be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none. If the second
parameter is "asc," then the function should return a list with the
numbers in ascending order. If it's "desc," then the list should be in
descending order, and if it's "none," it should return the original list
unaltered.
